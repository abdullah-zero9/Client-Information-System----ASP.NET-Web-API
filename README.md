# Client Information System - ASP.NET Web API

Welcome to the Client Information System ASP.NET Web API project! This API is designed to manage client information using the Generic Repository pattern. It provides a robust backend for storing and retrieving client data, including client details, addresses, and country information.

## Project Overview

The Client Information System is built on the principles of the Repository pattern, offering a flexible and maintainable approach to data access. It focuses on managing client data, including their personal information, addresses, and associated countries.

### Key Features

- **Client CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on client records, enabling efficient management of client information.

- **Client Addresses**: Store and manage client addresses, allowing clients to have multiple addresses associated with their profiles.

- **Country Information**: Maintain a list of countries and associate clients with specific countries.

### Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Web API (.NET 3.1)**: The core framework for building RESTful web APIs in C#.

- **Entity Framework**: Utilized for data modeling and database access, making it easier to interact with the underlying data store.
